# Furman University Â· Camerarius Notebooks

This repository hosts Jupyter notebooks for working withdata from the  [Camerarius project](https://github.com/Furman-Editions-In-Progress/camerarius).

These notebooks use the [Almond kernel](https://almond.sh/).  You can run a notebook server with the Almond kernel using a docker container like this:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 almondsh/almond:0.9.0

You can also work interactively with these notebooks on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Furman-Editions-In-Progress/camerarius-notebooks/master).

If you have Jupyter Notebooks installed locally, with the Almond kernal, you can run this with:

    jupyter notebook
