This repository hosts Jupyter notebooks for working withdata from the  [Camerarius project](https://github.com/Furman-Editions-In-Progress/camerarius).

These notebooks use the [Almond kernel](https://almond.sh/).  You can run a notebook server with the Almond kernel using a docker container like this:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 almondsh/almond:0.9.0

You can also work interactively with these notebooks on [mybinder.org]().

If you have Jupyter Notebooks installed locally, with the Almond kernal, you can run this with:

    jupyter notebook

This work is based on that of [Neel Smith](https://github.com/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter).
